For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[1m2/2\u001b[0m \u001b[32m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[37m\u001b[0m \u001b[1m0s\u001b[0m 187ms/step\n","\n","Metrics on Unscaled Data (Model 3):\n","Mean Squared Error (MSE): 90.8127\n","Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 9.5296\n","Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 8.4170\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ae44d1e1"},"source":["## Explore different lstm architectures\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Modify the LSTM model by adding more layers, changing the number of units in the layers, or trying bidirectional LSTMs to see if performance improves.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"72212047"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","Define, compile, train, predict, inverse transform, and evaluate a new LSTM model with a different architecture (adding a second LSTM layer) to see if performance improves.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":480},"id":"cc725483","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1754092403709,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":57,"user":{"displayName":"Dev Daev","userId":"03281078468309272357"}},"outputId":"4968444f-48a8-4ec4-958a-95ee93a99e57"},"source":["from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error\n","\n","# Define a new Sequential model with a different LSTM architecture (two LSTM layers)\n","model_improved = Sequential()\n","model_improved.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', return_sequences=True, input_shape=(train_features_scaled_df.shape[0], 1, train_features_scaled_df.shape[1]))) # Added return_sequences=True\n","model_improved.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu'))\n","model_improved.add(Dense(1))\n","\n","# Compile the new model\n","optimizer_improved = Adam(learning_rate=0.0005) # Using the better learning rate from hyperparameter tuning\n","model_improved.compile(optimizer=optimizer_improved, loss='mse')\n","model_improved.summary()\n","\n","# Reshape the training and testing features for multiple LSTM layers\n","# The previous reshaping was already suitable for this architecture (samples, timesteps, features)\n","train_features_reshaped = train_features_scaled_df.values.reshape((train_features_scaled_df.shape[0], 1, train_features_scaled_df.shape[1]))\n","test_features_reshaped = test_features_scaled_df.values.reshape((test_features_scaled_df.shape[0], 1, test_features_scaled_df.shape[1]))\n","\n","# Train the new model\n","print(\"\\nTraining Improved Model (Two LSTM layers, Learning Rate=0.0005, Epochs=150, Batch Size=16)...\")\n","history_improved = model_improved.fit(train_features_reshaped, train_target_scaled_df, epochs=150, batch_size=16, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)\n","\n","# Make predictions on the testing data\n","predictions_scaled_improved = model_improved.predict(test_features_reshaped)\n","\n","# Inverse transform the scaled predictions\n","predictions_unscaled_improved = target_scaler.inverse_transform(predictions_scaled_improved)\n","\n","# Inverse transform the test target (already done in previous steps, but re-doing for clarity within this block)\n","test_target_unscaled = target_scaler.inverse_transform(test_target_scaled_df)\n","\n","# Calculate and print the unscaled evaluation metrics\n","mse_unscaled_improved = mean_squared_error(test_target_unscaled, predictions_unscaled_improved)\n","rmse_unscaled_improved = np.sqrt(mse_unscaled_improved)\n","mae_unscaled_improved = mean_absolute_error(test_target_unscaled, predictions_unscaled_improved)\n","\n","print(\"\\nMetrics on Unscaled Data (Improved Model):\")\n","print(f\"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse_unscaled_improved:.4f}\")\n","print(f\"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse_unscaled_improved:.4f}\")\n","print(f\"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae_unscaled_improved:.4f}\")"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/keras/src/layers/rnn/rnn.py:200: UserWarning: Do not pass an `input_shape`/`input_dim` argument to a layer.

Finally, I will calculate and print the unscaled evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) for the ARIMA model's predictions.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":383},"id":"0b50ba2c","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1754092466959,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2388,"user":{"displayName":"Dev Daev","userId":"03281078468309272357"}},"outputId":"79679550-e5a6-4c54-ce39-cef0e7ecad7e"},"source":["from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error\n","import numpy as np\n","import pmdarima as pm\n","\n","# The target variable is 'Cholera_Cases'\n","train_target = train_df['Cholera_Cases']\n","test_target = test_df['Cholera_Cases']\n","\n","# Use auto_arima to find the best ARIMA model order\n","auto_model = pm.auto_arima(train_target, seasonal=False, stepwise=True,\n","                           suppress_warnings=True, error_action='ignore',\n","                           max_p=5, max_q=5, max_d=2)\n","\n","print(f\"Best ARIMA order: {auto_model.order}\")\n","\n","# Train the ARIMA model with the best order\n","arima_model = ARIMA(train_target, order=auto_model.order)\n","arima_model_fit = arima_model.fit()\n","\n","# Make predictions on the test set\n","predictions_arima = arima_model_fit.forecast(steps=len(test_target))\n","\n","# Calculate and print unscaled evaluation metrics for ARIMA model\n","mse_unscaled_arima = mean_squared_error(test_target, predictions_arima)\n","rmse_unscaled_arima = np.sqrt(mse_unscaled_arima)\n","mae_unscaled_arima = mean_absolute_error(test_target, predictions_arima)\n","\n","print(\"\\nMetrics on Unscaled Data (ARIMA Model):\")\n","print(f\"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse_unscaled_arima:.4f}\")\n","print(f\"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse_unscaled_arima:.4f}\")\n","print(f\"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae_unscaled_arima:.4f}\")"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No module named 'pmdarima'","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m                       Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipython-input-1317522283.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfrom\u001b[0m \u001b[0msklearn\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mmetrics\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmean_squared_error\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmean_absolute_error\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnumpy\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnp\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 4\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mpmdarima\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mpm\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# The target variable is 'Cholera_Cases'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m: No module named 'pmdarima'","","\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0;32m\nNOTE: If your import is failing due to a missing package, you can\nmanually install dependencies using either !pip or !apt.\n\nTo view examples of installing some common dependencies, click the\n\"Open Examples\" button below.\n\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m\n"],"errorDetails":{"actions":[{"action":"open_url","actionText":"Open Examples","url":"/notebooks/snippets/importing_libraries.ipynb"}]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"63b6b469"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","The previous command failed because the `pmdarima` library was not installed.
